# Patient-Medical-Record-Dispatch

# Introduction
A patient record system is a type of clinical information system, which is dedicated to collecting, storing, manipulating, and making available clinical information important to the delivery of patient care.

# Goal
1. The maintenance of records of the patients is highly manual intensive. The file for each patient is kept and is retrieved upon the subsequent visit.
2. We face a lot of problems in paper based medical report like lack of immediate retrievals, lack of prompt updating, etc.
3. So to overcome this problem we have to use a system with less manual intervention.
4. This system provides online storage, updations and retrieval facility. This system promises very less paper work and also provides help to Doctor and operational staff.
5. In this system everything is stored electronically and information can be retrieved very easily without searching here and there into registers.
